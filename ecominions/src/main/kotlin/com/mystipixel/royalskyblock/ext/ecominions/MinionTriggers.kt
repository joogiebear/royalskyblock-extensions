/**
 * Exposes EcoMinions activity to libreforge as triggers.
 *
 * EcoMinions fires perfectly good Bukkit events but registers no libreforge elements of its own, so
 * nothing in any eco config can react to a minion doing anything. Registering the triggers closes
 * that: libreforge elements registered by *any* plugin work in *all* of them, so this one file makes
 * EcoItems, EcoQuests, Talismans, Boosters and RoyalSkyblock's own perks and upgrades minion-aware at
 * once — a talisman that pays out when a minion harvests, a quest for placing your tenth minion, an
 * island perk that scales with how many you run.
 *
 * ## Why reflection
 *
 * EcoMinions is not a compile dependency. The suite's published artifacts are not reliable — every
 * released `com.willfp:EcoMobs` jar turned out to be an empty stub — so nothing here is linked at
 * compile time. The events are resolved from EcoMinions' own classloader at runtime and registered
 * with a dynamic executor. Absent or reshaped EcoMinions means the triggers simply are not registered.
 *
 * ## What each trigger carries
 *
 * `player` and `location` (the minion's), plus `text` set to the minion's type id and `value` to a
 * number that means something per event — the minion's level, or the tier reached for an upgrade.
 * `text` is what lets a config say "only my farm minions" without inventing a filter for it.
